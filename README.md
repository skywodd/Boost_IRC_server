# Simple but powerful (local only) IRC server written in C++ using Boost## by SkyWoddWritten for a homework from my computer science school. Not a real project, just a "code and forget" project for school.Designed to be :* multi-platform (using Boost libraries)* single-threaded (I'm too lazy to add multi-threading)* (at most) errors safe* RFC1495 compatible, BUT NOT TOTALY (Deadline too close to implement correctly all commands)---### Compilation remarksThis program require Boost with Asio.signal (>= 1_47) to have signals support !If compiled with an older version of Boost signals support will be automaticaly disabled.Coded, tested, compiled and debugged on Windows 7 with Boost 1_51 using Eclipse Juno.---### Supported IRC commandsCommand    - Support - Comment (if any)* PASS     - full    - Does not make difference between client and server PASS* NICK     - half    - No nickname collision check (TODO)* USER     - full    - Ignore host name and server name (set at connection)* SERVER   - no      - Always answer with ERR_ALREADYREGISTRED* OPER     - half    - ERR_NOOPERHOST not supported* QUIT     - full    - * SQUIT    - no      - Always answer with ERR_NOPRIVILEGES * JOIN     - half    - No multiple channel / key arguments support* PART     - full    - * MODE     - TODO    - TODO* TOPIC    - full    - * NAMES    - half    - Does not support "all channels" listing* LIST     - half    - Does not support "all channels" listing* INVITE   - full    - * KICK     - half    - Does not support extended KICK format* VERSION  - full    -* STATS    - TODO    - TODO* LINKS    - no      - Always answer with RPL_ENDOFLINKS* TIME     - full    - * CONNECT  - no      - Always answer with ERR_NOPRIVILEGES* TRACE    - no      - Do nothing* ADMIN    - full    - * INFO     - full    - * WHO      - TODO    - TODO* WHOIS    - TODO    - TODO* WHOAS    - no      - Always answer with ERR_WASNOSUCHNICK* NOTICE   - full    - * PRIVMSG  - full    - * KILL     - half    - ERR_CANTKILLSERVER not supported* PING     - full    - Does not answer to request with deamon 2 != local server domain* PONG     - full    - * ERROR    - no      - Do nothing* AWAY     - full    -* REHASH   - half    - Supported but no configuration file used yet (TODO)* RESTART  - full    - Stop server, service must be restarted by an external launcher* SUMMON   - half    - Always answer with ERR_SUMMONDISABLED* USERS    - half    - Always answer with ERR_USERSDISABLED* WALLOPS  - full    - Need to be IRC ops to send wallops (avoid denial of service from regular users)* USERHOST - full    -* ISON     - full    ----### Remarks about the makefileThe makefile have been generated by eclipse, I'm too lazy to make a clean one by hand.The makefile compile with -O0 -g options but store the binary in the "release" directory, it's NOT a mistake !The final executable have to be compiled with these options for my school subject.The code compile without problems on a debian squeeze.If you are compiling on windows just open the makefile in the root directory of the project and uncomment lines in it.
