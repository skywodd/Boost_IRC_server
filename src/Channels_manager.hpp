 * Add, remove and access operations are made using channel name.\n
 * Remove operations can also be made using intelligent pointer.\n
 * \n
 * This class keep up-to-date a counter of channels currently into the database.\n
 * Each channel name are associated to a channel informations intelligent pointer.\n

 * Channels broadcast operation are NOT handled by this class (see Channel_info instead).
